# hw9_d-n-dice3
Repo for HW 9

We will use this repo as the starting point for Homework 9

This will simulate buying in to an existing project by downloading its repo; then initializing it with Nodejs. Note that the *node_modules* folder isn't present in the repo because doing so would be superfluous and wasteful of storage

This assignment will focus on JavaScript, but we may, or may not, need to modify the project's CSS before we're done, so we'll want to be able to run the Sass dependency
